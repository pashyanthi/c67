Once upon a time in a forest there lived a Monkey,who recided on a berry tree,which was on the bank of the river.In the same forest there
 lived a crocodile and his wife.One day the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.The kind-hearted Monkey offered him some fruits .The Crocodile came back next day for more fruits as he loves them.
 As Days passed by crocodile and monkey became good friends.One day the monkey sent some fruits for the crocodile's wife.She ate them and liked them,but was jealous as She did'nt
 like her husband spending time with the monkey.she told her husband that if the fruits are so juicy I wonder how sweet the monkey's heart would be.
 Get me the heart of monkey she told.
 the crocodile was not willing to kill monkey but had no choice
